<font size="4" color="white">Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets<br>
to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it<br>
 may be played
 with larger teams, 
the most common forms<br> of the game are "singles"
 (with one player per side) and<br>
 "doubles" 
(with two players per side).<br>
<br> Badminton
 is often played as a casual outdoor activity in 
a yard or on a beach;<br> formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court.<br> 
Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet<br> and landing it
within the opposing side's half of the court.<br>
Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it<br> passes over the net.
Play ends once the shuttlecock has<br> struck the floor or if a fault has been called 
by the umpire,<br> service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side. <br>

<font color="white" size="4">The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports.<br>
In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed<br> 
compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.<br>
<br>
The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play came to be dominated<br> 
by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions dominated by China. In 1992, badminton debuted<br> 
as a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles;[2] mixed doubles<br> 
was added four years later. At high levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility,<br> 
strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated<br> 
racquet movements.</font>
